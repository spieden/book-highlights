# The Gardener and the Carpenter by Gopnik, Alison

there is a countervailing impulse to devalue the importance of being a parent— hence all the wry memoirs in which women self- consciously confess to their ambivalence about motherhood.


The most important rewards of being a parent aren’t your children’s grades and trophies— or even their graduations and weddings. They come from the moment- by- moment physical and psychological joy of being with this particular child, and in that child’s moment- by- moment joy in being with you.


Loving children doesn’t give them a destination; it gives them sustenance for the journey.


There are admittedly some kinds of gardening where the aim is a particular outcome, such as growing hothouse orchids


In England, that land of gardeners, they use the term “hothousing” to refer to the kind of anxious middle- class parenting that Americans call helicoptering.


There is very little evidence that conscious decisions about co- sleeping or not, letting your children “cry it out” or holding them till they fall asleep, or forcing them to do extra homework or letting them play have reliable and predictable long- term effects on who those children become. From an empirical perspective, parenting is a mug’s game.


What was once a matter of experience has become a matter of expertise. What was once simply a way of being, what the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein called a form of life, became a form of work.


Instead of waiting for natural selection to turn us into more well- adapted creatures, we adapt on our own by trying out many different pictures of the world (different theories), keeping the ones that fit the data and eliminating the ones that don’t. The philosopher Karl Popper said that science lets our theories die in our stead.


Great generals and executives don’t think through every possible plan and pick the absolutely best one; they pick one that is good enough and execute it confidently and decisively.


in a field called epigenetics. There is a long, winding path that connects our genes to the shapes our bodies and minds finally take.


Research in epigenetics shows how features of the environment, even quite subtle ones such as the quality of caregiving, can make genes active or inactive.


If you have a child with a small genetic tendency toward risk- taking, you will probably treat him very differently, even just unconsciously, than you treat his more timid brother, and that difference in nurture will greatly amplify the difference in nature.


a one- year- old brain has twice as many neural connections as your brain does.


In the world before parenting, even toddlers could explore the environment they would grow up in— the village or the farm, the workshop or the kitchen. Middle- class American children now spend much of their lives in highly structured settings;


we can’t precisely anticipate what that new order will be; that’s the whole point of the generational human reboot.


We’re the only primate that continues to live, thrive, and take care of children well past the age when we can no longer bear children ourselves.


Cultural evolution influences human actions more than those of any other animal, and that adds a whole extra layer of complexity.


It’s no wonder, then, that hypotheses about our evolutionary origins so often seem like academic Rorschach tests. It’s hard not to smile a little when, at an evolutionary psychology meeting, ferocious professorial silverbacks furiously argue that small- group warfare is the origin of everything most important about us.


Chimpanzees are mobile at three or four months, are sexually mature at about eight or nine years old, and have their first babies at ten or eleven.


after our babies are weaned they remain dependent on others for food— recall that hazelnut biscotto. As a consequence, we actually end up having more, and more needy, babies than our primate relatives.


When more babies are likely to make it through to adulthood, you can afford to invest more in supporting each one.


immaturity also correlates specifically with larger brains, and with increased intelligence, flexibility, and learning abilities.


Ornithologists— not thinking about humans at all— long ago distinguished between what they called altricial and precocial birds.


when you just sit still, about 20 percent of your calories go to your brain. One- year- olds use much more than that, and by four, fully 66 percent of calories go to the brain, more than at any other period of development.


Anatomically modern humans, humans with the same skeletons we have, evolved some two hundred thousand years ago.


It wasn’t just that the weather got colder or hotter, wetter or drier. Instead, the climate became more variable and more unpredictable; it was harder to tell just what sort of weather humans would face, both within and across generations. Climate change caused humans long before humans caused climate change.


How do you deal with variability and change? Mathematical models (and common sense) suggest that you meet variability with variability. By varying what individual children are like, how they think and develop, and what they learn from others, all those children stand a better chance of survival when things change. As a result we can expect a great deal of apparently random variability in the temperament and development of children, and in the behavior of adults.


Now, though, I have to report on a different and in some ways even stranger experience. On October 8, 2012, when Augie was born and I held him for the first time, I was exactly the same person I was on October 7. There were no hormonal changes, no baby kicking, no radical transformations of body and mind. And yet without any of that preparation, I’ve experienced something similar. There is the same specific intense love, the sense that this baby, in particular, is someone I would give my life for.


At fifteen lust leads to love, at fifty- five love leads to lust. For grandmothers, our commitments drive our emotions rather than the other way around.


care for children becomes part of caring for one another. The very demands of cooperatively caring for children lead to bonds of care and love among those who do this work. In fact, “cooperative breeding,” as our collective investment is unromantically called, may have helped lead to other kinds of care— to human altruism and cooperation, in general.


Many birds pair- bond, but there are only a few pair- bonding mammals, including just one other ape, the gibbon.


The great ethologist and anthropologist Irenäus Eibl- Eibesfeldt once told me about a “first contact” with a remote tribe. After all his inquiries about the ways of the tribe, he asked if they had any questions for him. “Yes,” they said, and asked, “Does it ever happen among your people that someone who is married to one person has sex with someone else?” It kept on happening to them, in spite of the fact that it made everybody miserable, so had Eibl- Eibesfeldt’s tribe come across this problem, and did they have any good suggestions?


Every generation or so the idea of guiltless sex reemerges with a hopeful new name— free love or open marriage or now polyamory— and with the same hopeless old problems of insecurity and jealousy.


But pair- bonding is highly correlated with “paternal investment”— with fathers who help take care of their babies. And that, logically enough, is related to the total investment— the total amount of work, resources, and care— that you need to raise a baby in the first place.


Forager groups generally seem to have some kind of pair- bonding with relative equality between men and women. With the rise of agriculture and larger and more unequal societies, a more polygynous, gorilla- like pattern emerged— with harems of many subordinate wives for one man.


there is the sheer physicality of our love for babies and small children, much like the physicality of romantic love— that sense of the beauty and deliciousness of the beloved. Like Maurice Sendak’s wild things, most lovers of babies have proclaimed, at least internally, “I’ll eat you up, I love you so!”


Scientists can actually change the voles’ genes. Some of the prairie voles’ genes make oxytocin. Meadow voles have the same genes, but they typically aren’t turned on. When scientists activate those genes, the promiscuous meadow voles change their behavior. They pair- bond like the prairie voles.


As far as we know, killer whales are the only other mammals who go through menopause.


Our modern average life expectancy is longer because fewer people die during childhood. Once we get through childhood, the difference is much less dramatic— in forager societies a woman who makes it past thirty is quite likely to live past sixty.


If just a few women live past menopause and use that time to care for their grandchildren, their genes will be more likely to spread.


Grandmothers and grandfathers provide a rich trove of cultural information. They connect children to two generations’ worth of experience and knowledge. Songs, stories, spells, recipes, even old wives’ tales— we learn them all at the feet of our grandmothers.


For fathers, grandparents, and alloparents, the emotions of care are triggered by a social context, by our immersion in a web of love that connects partners, parents, and others, and by what we experience, believe, and learn. Even more than other animals, humans respond to the act of caring itself.


in fathers, caring for babies also decreases testosterone and its associated feelings of aggression and anger.


studies even show that the same oxytocin that helps us trust and love people inside our own group also makes us less tolerant of people outside it.


What makes us love a child isn’t something about the child— it’s something about us. We don’t care for children because we love them; we love them because we care for them.


Children may be sensitive to the information they get from other people, but they are not passively shaped by others. Instead, they actively interpret and try to understand both what people do and why they do it.


In some ways, at least, your children may actually know more about you than you do yourself. Children are tuned in to details of how parents act that you may not even notice. For example, preschoolers notice whether you say “Let’s see what this does” or “Let me show you what this does.”


children actually learn more from the unconscious details of what caregivers do than from any of the conscious manipulations of parenting.


Like traditional myths, neuroscience myths capture our intuitions about the human condition through vivid metaphors.


The “left brain/ right brain” idea


is only distantly related to the real, and really complicated, functional differences between the two hemispheres.


Apes don’t actually do much aping. The fact that macaques have mirror neurons actually demonstrates that these cells alone can’t explain our social behavior.


In spite of the equally strong association between the moving car and the flashing toy, the twenty- four- month- olds in this experiment surprisingly didn’t push the car at all. They just sat there, even when we asked them to make the toy flash. They didn’t even look toward the toy when the car moved— it’s as if they genuinely didn’t get that the car would make the toy flash.


On the other hand, if her hands are free, the babies will imitate her exactly. They’ll bang their heads on the box. Now they seem to think: “If she could have used her hands she would have, so there must be a reason she used her head.”


very young children aren’t just directly reproducing what they see a caregiver do. Instead, they’re reading through to the intention of the person— they’re figuring out what the person was trying to accomplish. They imitate the goal of the action instead of the action itself. They assume that the experimenter is trying to be efficient. They adjust what they do to suit their own goals and purposes. And they take statistics and probability into account, too.


younger learners are better than older ones at figuring out unlikely options.


In “exploit” learning we try to quickly find the solution that is most likely to work right now. In “explore” learning we try out lots of possibilities, including unlikely ones, even if they may not have much immediate payoff. To thrive in a complicated world you need both kinds of learning.


When the experimenter said that she had no idea how the toy worked, the children acted efficiently and intelligently and creatively; they imitated only the necessary actions. But when she indicated that she was an expert, they faithfully imitated every detail of her actions, whether they were necessary or not.


by default, the children assumed that the adult had special expertise, which she was trying to pass on. This might explain why in the Horner and Whiten study, the children, unlike the chimps, reproduced irrelevant actions.


Rituals are designed especially to communicate to other people that you belong to a particular social group.


when the action seemed purposeless— when, for example, the experimenter took the pen off the table and then after twirling it elaborately put it right back in the same place, the children were much more likely to insist on reproducing every fine detail of the action themselves.


They seemed to think: “Well, I know you don’t have to do it that way, but I guess this is how she does it, so I’ll humor her.”


When the person spoke the same language, children used their heads; when she spoke a different language, they used their hands. The children seemed to think that they should imitate the exact actions only of the person who was like them.


Mayan children attend to, imitate, and master difficult and dangerous adult skills such as making tortillas or using a machete, skills that we would never think of teaching young children.


The parents are supposed to do something that is directed only at the child, something the parents would never do otherwise, like holding up cards and naming the objects on them. There are even apps that text such suggestions to parents. But for children, observing and imitating their parents and others as they behave in skilled and useful ways is an education in itself.


this is easier said than done, especially when, if you’re like me, it sometimes seems that the only skilled action you actually get a chance to do is to peck letters on a keyboard.


Just as you wouldn’t measure your marriage by its effects on your husband or wife, you also wouldn’t set aside particular activities that you directed only at them, and then measure whether those activities had the desired effect.


The key to love in practice is doing things together— whether it’s working, child- rearing, lovemaking, taking a walk, or baking a cake— participating in the world in a way that accommodates the strengths and weaknesses of both of you.


Children are often better at figuring out what you say and what you mean— which may not be the same thing— than you are yourself.


“Secure” babies are unhappy when their mothers leave and joyful when they return. “Avoidant” babies, in contrast, look away when their mother leaves, and continue to actively avoid looking at her even when she returns. They act as if they simply don’t care. But, in one of the saddest findings in all of psychology, it turns out that when you measure the avoidant babies’ heart rates, you discover that they are actually terribly upset— they have just learned to hide how they feel.


These differences in how babies behave are remarkably robust. They even predict what the baby’s adult love life will be like, statistically at least (there are always plenty of exceptions).


The secure children said “fep” in the gadget experiment— they chose to learn from their mother rather than a stranger when either one could be right. But in the fish- bird experiment they said “bird”— they went with the stranger when she was more likely to be right. But four- year- olds who had been avoidant babies behaved differently: they were equally likely to say “fep” or “dax.” They would learn as readily from a stranger as from their mother. Those who had been anxious babies behaved differently still: they chose the mother’s word even when she was likely to be wrong, as in the case of the fish- bird.


children themselves are actively interpreting what they hear, and doing so based on very general kinds of information that would be impossible to consciously control. And a stable, secure base of love seems to be more important than the details of what parents say.


When the speaker was ignorant and uncertain, they went with the facts as they had seen them. But when she was confident and knowledgeable, the children seemed conflicted, and they chose the “right” block only about half the time. They seemed to give the confident person some of the benefit of the doubt. After all, unlike in the “three lines” experiment, there was some uncertainty about just how effective the blocks were going to be, anyway.


the children were no more skeptical of the overconfident fellow than of the modest one. Children seem to be even more vulnerable to blowhards than the rest of us.


recent work shows that even the youngest children are actually quite good at sensing the subtle cues that make history, fact, and reality fundamentally different from fantasy and fiction.


The world of fiction and pretense is what philosophers call a counterfactual world.


Are those endless questions really genuine, or are they just a way of prolonging the conversation and getting attention? In fact, the most recent studies show that children really do want answers to their questions, really do look


Preschoolers averaged nearly seventy- five questions per hour.


in one study researchers gave parents and children a bowl of water and a bunch of objects and asked them to figure out why some things sink and others float. The middle- class highly schooled parents and children treated this like a school activity— they spent more time talking about how the lesson would proceed than they did about sinking and floating. The less advantaged parents, with much less schooling, actually talked more about the actual problem, and their children asked deeper, more conceptual questions.


When the adults gave a reasonable explanation the children moved on or advanced the conversation, asking, for example, “Why do people work as clowns?” When the adults didn’t give a good explanation, the children persisted with the original question: “Why does he have a clown nose?”


Children don’t just want more information about the world; they want causal information that will let them understand the world in a deeper and broader way— information that will enable future learning. And, remarkably, children recognize when they don’t possess this sort of deep, causal information, and they go out of their way to get it.


The conventional wisdom, from Piaget to Montessori to Freud, was that young children’s thinking is restricted to the here and now, to immediate sensation and direct perception. It turns out instead that even the youngest children look below the surface to try to understand the deeper essences of the things around them. In fact, when children make mistakes, it’s often because they are looking too hard for essences when there are actually none to be found.


In one of those bitter, teeth- gritting ironies, it turned out that moms used generics even when they were trying to combat sexism. Saying “Girls can drive trucks” still implies that girls all belong in the same category with the same deep, underlying essence.


Subtle aspects of how the adults talked influenced how the children thought about the Zarpies. But they also influenced how children talked about real ducks and squirrels— and real boys and girls. It doesn’t take much extrapolation to see that children might interpret generics the same way when they are applied to other social groups: Mexican and American, black and white, Hutu and Tutsi, Serb and Croat.


Young children learn from others with alacrity and ease, and they are remarkably skilled at getting the information they need and interpreting that information. Parents don’t have to consciously manipulate what they say to give children the information they need.


Fundamental relationships of trust are more important than teaching strategies.


conversation is a way of establishing a relationship, a way of being with another person. There is no surer sign of love than the back- and- forth of teasing and banter, diminutives and endearments, soul- searching and chitchat. There is no signal of a failed intimacy more devastating than refusing to talk to the other person. Children learn by being part of that kind of intimate, open- ended, dynamic conversation.


Paradoxically, even hearing inaccurate or misleading information can help children learn. They learn not only what someone has said but how reliable they are, and how much to trust them in the future.


In human children, early rough- and- tumble play is associated with better social competence later on.


As adults, the play- deprived rats have difficulty dealing with other rats, and their difficulties are instructive. They can do the same kinds of things as the rats who played. They know how to attack and defend, how to make overtures to others, and how to retreat. But they don’t know when to do what. Whether they are fighting or courting, they can’t react to the other rats in the swift, flexible, and fluid fashion of the roughhousing rats.


Karl Popper pointed out that good scientists should be more interested in evidence that contradicts their theories than evidence that confirms


Children start to pretend when they are just a year old, and pretending reaches its zenith around three or four.


Archaeologists have recovered four- thousand- year- old dolls and miniature kitchen utensils in Bronze Age children’s quarters.


Children do experiments and make observations, although we call it “getting into everything.”


play is what happens when young animals exercise a useful skill even though it doesn’t immediately lead to a useful result.


Thinking counterfactually in this way is a tremendously useful skill for adult human beings. It’s what we mean when we talk about the power of imagination and creativity.


In order to change the world, we need to imagine that the world could be different, and then actually set about making it that way. In fact, just about everything in the room I’m sitting in— the woven fabrics, the carpentered chairs, not to mention the electric lights and computers— is wildly fictional from the perspective of a Pleistocene forager.


By far the most important and interesting problem for young children is figuring out what’s going on in other people’s minds.


the period from eighteen months to five years is the great watershed for developing theory of mind.


the psychologist Marjorie Taylor found that some 66 percent of preschoolers have some kind of imaginary companion,


Younger children say that they always thought there were clips in the box and so will everyone else. By five most kids can understand their own past false beliefs and the false beliefs of others. Children with autism, though, have special difficulty solving this kind of problem.


For adults, fiction and drama are the equivalent of pretend play and imaginary companions. And studies show that reading fiction can have the same advantages as pretending. People who read a great deal of fiction are consistently more empathetic and better at understanding other people.


Middlemarch


The very silliness of play, the apparently random weirdness of it all, is what makes it so effective.


Why do we take special pleasure in playful actions? It’s easy to learn that a goal- directed action is worth doing— after all, we reach the goal and get rewarded. But how do you ensure that an animal or a child will be able to deal with a situation that evolution hasn’t anticipated beforehand?


we don’t play because we think that eventually it will give us robust cognitive functions— although that may be the evolutionary motivation for play. We play because it is just so much fun.


When the experimenter activated the toy accidentally, the children were fascinated and they played. Just by randomly trying different actions they discovered all the things that the toy could do. But when the experimenter acted like a teacher, the children would squeak the beeper, and then squeak it again and again, ad nauseam, instead of trying something new.


When the adult said that she had no idea how the toy worked, the children discovered the more intelligent strategy. But when she acted like a teacher and said that she was showing the child how the toy worked, the children imitated everything the teacher did instead.


Ironically, contemporary middle- class parents may allow themselves license to play only if they are convinced that it is part of the work of parenting. There is a famously puritan streak in America.


Schools have really only been around for a couple of hundred years, an eye- blink in human history.


Many of the most effective teachers, even in modern schools, use elements of apprenticeship. Ironically, though, these teachers are more likely to be found in the “extracurricular” classes than in the required ones. The stern but beloved baseball coach or the demanding but passionate music teacher let children learn this way.


You learn to write by writing, over and over again, especially with a good editor. (John Kenneth Galbraith said that the note of spontaneity his critics liked so much generally came in around the ninth draft.)


Matajuro and the copywriter didn’t learn in order to pass the swordsmanship SAT or the copywriting final exam. The process and the outcome of their learning were indistinguishable. Learning to play baseball doesn’t prepare you to be a baseball player— it makes you a baseball player.


there is good evidence that the best predictors of reading performance in school are how much children hear language at home and how many books they encounter.


By the time they arrive in our classes, many Berkeley undergraduates are absolute Matajuros of test- taking. It’s no wonder we’re gravely disappointed— and they’re resentfully surprised— when we ask them to actually be apprentice scientists or scholars instead.


Being the best test- taker in the world isn’t much help for discovering either new truths about that world or new ways of thriving in it.


the origami experiment: indigenous children learned by just watching the teacher demonstrate the skill to another child, while Western children learned only when the teacher explicitly taught them.


For younger children consciousness seems to be more like a lantern, illuminating everything at once. When we say that preschoolers are bad at paying attention, what we really mean is that they’re bad at not paying attention— they have difficulty keeping themselves from being drawn to distractions.


a fascinating recent set of studies has found parallels between the brain activity of people on psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and the brain activity of very young children. Compared with typical brains, your brain on these drugs is less coordinated: the different brain areas are more independent, and the executive frontal areas exert much less control. It’s as if the drugs somehow lead your brain to regress to a state that resembles the preschool brain.


Habit makes much of the world invisible. Psychedelics and other forms of “expanded consciousness” make us sensitive to those parts of the world again.


The researchers looked at the relationship between when a state introduced new policies that included high- stakes testing and the rate of ADHD diagnoses. Immediately after the policies were introduced, the diagnoses increased dramatically. Moreover, the diagnoses rose particularly sharply for poor children in public schools.


Notably, the researchers didn’t see comparable increases in places where the law expressly prevented school personnel from recommending ADHD medication to parents.


Rather than thinking of ADHD as a disease like smallpox we should think of it as a particular point on a continuum of attentional style. Some children have no trouble achieving even “unnatural” levels of highly focused attention; others find it practically impossible to focus attention at all; and most are in between. That variation didn’t matter much for hunters, foragers, or farmers— in fact, broader attention might actually be an advantage for hunters.


Narrowing attention may be part of growing up, but wide attention is part of being young.


Instead of drugging children’s brains to get them to fit our schools, we could change our schools to accommodate a wider range of children’s brains.


A standardized test score is the apotheosis of the goal- directed, child- shaping, carpentry picture of schooling— the idea that schools should be designed to turn all children into creatures with particular characteristics.


The greatest and most challenging transition in the school- age period is the transition from a life that is centered on our caregivers to one that is instead centered on our peers— the friends and enemies, leaders and followers, and lovers and rivals who will dominate our lives as adults.


Managing wide- ranging networks of friendships and alliances, divisions of labor, negotiations, compromises, and interests is among our most significant human challenges. When school- age children play with their friends, they are developing these abilities.


Deciding on rules for wall ball is a prelude to legislation; building a tree house is building a city in miniature.


Studies by the neuroscientist B. J. Casey suggest that adolescents are reckless not because they underestimate risks but because they overestimate rewards— or, rather, find rewards more rewarding than adults do. The reward centers of the adolescent brain are much more active than those of either children or adults.


The precise reason puberty is kicking in at an earlier and earlier age is still unknown. A leading theory points to changes in energy balance. Children eat more and move less— the same changes that are responsible for the obesity epidemic may be affecting the onset of puberty, too. Other candidates include artificial light— exacerbated by the contemporary trend toward screens at bedtime— and even hormonelike substances in the environment, particularly in sources such as plastic containers.


In studies that look at how children’s brains change over time, researchers have found that children whose frontal lobes mature relatively late are likely to have higher IQs.


while talking, seeing, and remembering are the result of hundreds of thousands of years of evolutionary change, the equally complex computations that are involved in reading are only a few thousand years old.


In order to read we reuse parts of the brain that were originally designed for other purposes.


fewer means of transportation can make it literally impossible for many adolescents to leave the house by themselves. Where can you go in Los Angeles without a car? The physical spaces of lover’s lane or the village square or the wilderness by the river have been replaced by the virtual spaces of the Web.


There is good evidence that most of us can keep track of only about a hundred other people— a village’s worth. The rise of cities led us to define that village socially instead of geographically; city dwellers learn not to acknowledge, or even see, most of the people they pass on the street, a skill that seems baffling and obnoxious to rural visitors.


Figuring out who we should talk with seems to be much harder. We can edit out the obnoxious guy on the street or ignore a ranting stranger more easily than we can filter out the anonymous inflammatory comment. On the Web, we all become small- town visitors lost in the big city, or at least so it seems now.


The puzzle is how to provide children with the rich, stable, secure context they need to grow up without expecting that we can or should be able to control how they turn out.


the ratchet mechanism depends on both sides of the generational divide. Innovation depends on tradition. The shift to new technologies and cultures wouldn’t be possible if caregivers didn’t pass on their own discoveries, traditions, skills, and values to their children, even if they can’t and shouldn’t expect that children will simply replicate those traditions.


The utilitarian principle of the greatest good for the greatest number should make you choose public schools. But a genuinely moral impulse to do the best for your children might lead you to private ones instead.


Rational decision- making assumes there is a single person with the same values before and after the decision. If I’m trying to decide whether to buy peaches or pears, I can safely assume that if I prefer peaches now, the same “I” will prefer them after my purchase. But what if making the decision turns me into a different person with different values?


Once I commit myself to a child, I’m literally not the same person I was before. My ego has expanded to include another person even though— especially though— that person is utterly helpless and unable to reciprocate. And even though— especially though— that person’s desires and goals may be very different from mine.


Deciding whether to have children isn’t just a matter of deciding what you want. It means deciding who you’re going to be.


Virginia Woolf, who chose not to have children, wisely said, “Never pretend that the things you haven’t got are not worth having.”


In the richest country on earth more than one- fifth of the children grow up in poverty. More children are poor than people in any other age group.


In a small- scale forager society, we could simply take it for granted that resources would flow to children and caregivers. As we saw in the chapters on evolution, distinctive and striking characteristics of human beings (distinctive evolutionary phenomena such as pair- bonding, grandparenting, and alloparenting) are designed to ensure that resources go to children even though— especially though— children can’t produce those resources themselves.


Until the nineteenth and even the twentieth century, most people lived and worked on farms, or in small local workshops or businesses.


In 1830, 70 percent of American children lived in families with two parents who both worked on a farm; only 15 percent lived in a “nuclear family” with a working father and a stay- at- home mom.


by 1989 less than a third of children were being raised in “nuclear families”—


There is no mystery about the moral advantages or the good practical consequences of policies such as universal prenatal care, home visitors and nurses, paid parental leave for men and women, universal and free preschool, and direct subsidies to parents.


Is this a reason for endorsing the parenting picture— where parenting shapes a particular kind of child who becomes a particular kind of adult? Not really. These early childhood programs influence the probabilities across the whole group— it’s still very hard to predict which individual children will succeed or fail.


Work is central to industrial and postindustrial society, but it lives in tension with both care and play. Work shapes the availability of resources for care, whether of the old or the young, and it also shapes the availability of resources for play.


It is a simple fact that I won’t see Augie’s life after forty, and that I can’t even begin to guess what that life will be like. But there’s another side to this. I won’t be here but he will, and so a part of me will be, too.
